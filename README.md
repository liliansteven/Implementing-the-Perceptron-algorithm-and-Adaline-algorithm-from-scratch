# Implement the Perceptron algorithm and Adaline algorithm and draw the boundary line from scratch :-
The Perceptron and Adaline is one of the oldest and simplest learning classifiers out there.

What Adaline and the Perceptron have in common :-

*  they are classifiers for binary classification
*  both have a linear decision boundary
* both can learn iteratively, sample by sample (the Perceptron naturally, and Adaline via stochastic gradient descent)
* both use a threshold function
